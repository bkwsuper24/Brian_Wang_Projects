   fun_problem.txt is untracked

c. README.md is staged
   fun_problem.txt is staged

d. README.md is modified
   fun_problem.txt is modified

e. README.md is staged
   fun_problem.txt is unmodified
   The contents of fun_problem.txt is empty because 'checkout' returns to the 
previous commit of the file, which was empty. All changes up until last commit
were undone.

f. README.md is modified
   We modified the file before we committed the changes, so therefore the status   goes back to modified even though we staged the file.

   bool empty() const = Theta(1)
   All this function does is check the size of the list, and returns false if
   the size is greater than 0, or returns true if size = 0.
   
   void push(const double& val) = Theta(1)
   This function pushes a new value to the top of the stack. This can be 
   reached in constant time because the function is only iterating through the
   list once, and finding the proper location to insert, which in this case is
   always the head. This was the fastest way to find the proper location to
   insert.

   double const& top() const = Theta(1)
   This function returns the current value on top of the stack, which is also
   the head of a linked list. This is reached in constant time because the
   function iterates through the stack/list once to get the value needed. This
   is the fastest way to find a certain value.

   void pop() = Theta(1)
   This function removes the top element of the stack by removing the head. This   can be reached in constant time because once again, the function is iterating   through the stack/list once to find the correct position and value to remove.
