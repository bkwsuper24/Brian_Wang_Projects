To Compile:

	qmake -project
	qmake
	make
	
I've also commented out my recommendations functions, due to it sometimes segfaults at runtime and I could not figure out the issue why. As a result, I didn't want to lose points from my login_window function from the previous problem.

I've attached splaytree.h separately, and I was not able to implement it with amazon. It does work byitself with a test file.
