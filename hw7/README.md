I have attached Makefile, but it is faulty, so follow directions below:


To compile the bst program: g++ -g -Wall bst.cpp -o bst

To run: ./bst

To compile the rbbst program: g++ -g -Wall rbbst.cpp -o rbbst

To run: ./rbbst

To compile the rectangles program: g++ -g -Wall rectangles.cpp -o rectangles

To run: ./rectangles input.txt output.txt



Problem 3 of the homework is split up into 3 pages, so I created a folder.
