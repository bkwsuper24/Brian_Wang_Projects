My program compiles with make. However, I have some sort of bug I can't fix. 
In my run function in puzzle_solver.cpp, my solution deque that I have is not being filled up.
I've tried hours to fix this, but I don't know why. I tested all other possible parts of my program,
and they work fine. Just wanted to let you know. Thank you!
